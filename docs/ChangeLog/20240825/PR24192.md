### SparkFun Pro Micro RP2040 converter renamed

The converter for the SparkFun Pro Micro RP2040 has been renamed.

from:

```
promicro_rp2040
```

to:

```c
sparkfun_rp2040
```

This change was made to avoid confusion between the clones named ProMicro RP2040 and the SparkFun Pro Micro RP2040. The clones should be using the `rp2040_ce` option.
